# Architecture Design Document (ADD) — Template

This template is generated on every `/ideation` for feature stories.
It describes the architecture of the planned change completely enough that an architect or
developer can start implementation without follow-up questions.

> **Important:** fill only the relevant sections. Not every story needs every section.
> A simple new agent needs no deployment diagram. But a new trade path needs every layer.
> Mark non-relevant sections with "— not affected —".

## 3. Data architecture

### 3.1 Data flow

Describes which data is created where, how it's transformed, and where it ends up.

| Source | Format | Transformation | Target | Frequency |
|--------|--------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| [API/Agent] | [JSON/WebSocket/...] | [normalization/scoring/...] | [signal file/DB/journal] | [5 min/event/...] |

### 3.2 New data structures

Defines new or changed data formats.

**Signal output** (if new agent):
```json
{
  "score": 0.0,
  "signal": "HOLD",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "timestamp": "ISO8601Z",
  "source": "agent-name",
  "assets": {
    "BTC": { "score": 0.0, "signal": "HOLD", "details": {} }
  }
}
```

**New DB tables** (if database affected):
```sql
-- Table name and purpose
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ... (
  ...
);
```

### 3.3 DB Impact (MANDATORY on database changes)

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is a new table needed? | Yes/No — if yes: schema, migration, dedup strategy |
| Is an existing table written to? | Yes/No — if yes: document the writer |
| Is an existing table read from? | Yes/No — if yes: document the reader |
| Does a table's impact profile change? | Yes/No — if yes: update impact matrix |

If everything "No": mark section with "— no DB impact —".

### 3.4 Data consistency

- **SSoT:** which file/table is authoritative?
- **Dual-write:** must JSONL + DB be written together?
- **Atomic writes:** write-then-rename for critical files?
- **Race conditions:** can parallel agents write to the same file?

## 4. API and integration design

### 4.1 External APIs (new or changed)

| API | Endpoint | Auth | Rate limit | Cost | Fallback |
|-----|----------|------|------------|------|----------|
| [Name] | [URL] | [Key/OAuth/...] | [X req/min] | [Free/$X/mo] | [Alternative or degradation] |

### 4.2 Internal interfaces

Which existing modules/libraries are used or extended?

| Module | Function | Change |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `lib/config.js` | [AGENT_WEIGHTS/SIGNAL_FILES/...] | [New entry / change] |
| `lib/signals.js` | [readSignal/writeSignal] | [None / extension] |
| `lib/http.js` | [fetchWithRetry] | [None / new endpoint] |

## 5. Infrastructure impact

|----------|---------|--------------|-------|
| CPU | [X%] | [Y%] | [+Z%] |
| RAM | [X MB] | [Y MB] | [+Z MB] |
| Disk | [X GB] | [Y GB] | [+Z GB] |

- **Finding:** [API cost? LLM tokens? New dependencies?]
- **Measure:** [Free tier? Caching? Daily limit?]

### 6.8 Signal Quality

## 7. Architecture decisions (ADRs)

Document important design decisions with rationale.

### ADR-1: [decision title]
- **Context:** [Why did we need to decide?]
- **Options:** [A: ... | B: ... | C: ...]
- **Decision:** [Chosen option + reasoning]
- **Consequences:** [What follows? Trade-offs?]

## 8. Risks and mitigations

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|------|------------|--------|------------|
| 1 | [description] | [Low/Medium/High] | [Low/Medium/High] | [Concrete measure] |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... |

---

## 9. Implementation notes

Concrete notes for the `/implement` skill / developer.

### 9.1 Affected files
| File | Change | Complexity |
|------|--------|-------------|
| [Path] | [New/Change/Delete] | [Low/Medium/High] |

### 9.2 Implementation order
1. [First step — e.g. config entries]
2. [Second step — e.g. core logic]
3. [Third step — e.g. integration + tests]

### 9.3 Config changes (config.js)
```javascript
// New entries in config.js
AGENT_WEIGHTS: { ..., 'new-agent': 0.03 },
SIGNAL_FILES: { ..., 'new-agent': 'signals/new-agent-signal.json' },
```

## Usage guidelines for the ideation skill

### When which scope?

| Story type | Required sections | Optional |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| **New agent** | 1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 6 (all), 9 | 2.3, 5, 7, 8 |
| **New trade path** | 1, 2 (all), 3 (all), 4, 5, 6 (all), 7, 8, 9 | — |
| **API integration** | 1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 6.3+6.4+6.7, 9 | rest |
| **Refactoring** | 1, 2.1, 6.6, 9 | 7, 8 |
| **Bug fix** | No ADD — story template fix is enough | — |
| **Dashboard/UI** | 1, 2.1, 4.2, 6.5, 9 | 5 |

### Agent team workflow

When agent teams are active, the ADD is created collaboratively:
1. **Lead** creates sections 1, 2.1, 9
2. **Architect teammate** creates sections 2.2, 2.3, 3, 4, 6, 7
3. **Cloud system engineer** creates section 5
4. **Everyone** reviews and challenges each other
5. **Lead** consolidates and presents to the operator

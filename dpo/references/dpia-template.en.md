## DPIA Structure

### 1. Description of the Processing

- **Processing activity:** [Name and description]
- **Purpose:** [Why are the data processed?]
- **Legal basis:** [Art. 6(1) lit. a-f + if applicable Art. 9(2)]
- **Controller:** [Organisation + contact details]
- **DPO contact:** [If available]

### 2. Data Inventory

| Data Category | Data Subjects | Source | Recipients | Storage Period | Deletion |
|----------------|-----------|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| [e.g. e-mail] | [Users] | [Registration] | [Internal + mail provider] | [2 years] | [Automatic] |

### 3. Necessity and Proportionality

- Is the processing **necessary** for the purpose?
- Are there **less intrusive means** (less data, shorter storage)?
- Is **data minimisation** complied with?
- Are data subjects **informed** (Art. 13/14)?
- Can data subjects **exercise their rights** (Art. 15-22)?

### 4. Risk Assessment

For each identified risk:

| Risk | Likelihood | Severity | Risk Level | Measure |
|--------|---------------------------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Unauthorised access | Medium | High | HIGH | Encryption + RBAC |
| Data loss | Low | High | MEDIUM | Backup + Disaster Recovery |
| Purpose limitation breach | Low | Medium | LOW | Access controls + logging |

**Risk matrix:**

| Severity \ Likelihood | Low | Medium | High |
|------------------------------|---------|--------|------|
| High | MEDIUM | HIGH | VERY HIGH |
| Medium | LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH |
| Low | LOW | LOW | MEDIUM |

### 5. Mitigation Measures

| Measure | Type | Implementation | Status |
|-----------|-----|-----------|--------|
| AES-256 encryption | Technical | → Security Architect | [ ] |

### 6. Result

- **Residual risk after measures:** Low / Medium / High
- **In case of high residual risk:** consultation of supervisory authority required (Art. 36)
- **Approval:** Date, responsible person
- **Next review:** [Date, at the latest 1 year]
